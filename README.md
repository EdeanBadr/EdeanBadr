#Hey, Iâ€™m Badr Eddine HABIB! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an embedded software engineer with a strong passion for Linux development, C++, and networking.
I specialize in multimedia pipelines and love tackling complex technical challenges, especially in 
the open-source and embedded systems space.

#What Drives Me:

Iâ€™m all about optimizing software for performance and diving into low-level systems. Linux is my 
playground, and Iâ€™m always eager to learn and collaborate.
